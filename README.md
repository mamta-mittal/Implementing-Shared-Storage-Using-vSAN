# Implementing-Shared-Storage-Using-vSAN
To implement vSAN using VMWare by adding an additional virtualization server in the above design.Three Dell R640 server were used at Sligo site to form a cluster (logical grouping of hosts) of three servers/hosts in High Availability mode such that if one server goes down, VMs of that host will be restarted on another host. VMWare ESXi hypervisor was used as virtualization platform and vSAN (Virtual Storage Area Network) was used to provide shared storage across the clusters where local disks and memory from all the three servers were used to create a big pool of storage which can be used by all the three servers in the cluster, thus providing efficient utilization of memory and hard disk. This was implemented in Sligo as well as Data Centers to provide higher performance.
